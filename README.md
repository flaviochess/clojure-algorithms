Famous algorithms in Clojure for learning the language


## Important
It's a study repository for me to learn Clojure. Don't use it how reference because I'm still learning the language.

Here don't have a project clojure structure, just a few loose files (namespaces).


## Algorithms

These algorithms are based on the book Grokking Algorithms.

1. Binary Search - O(log n)
2. Selection Sort - O(nÂ²)
3. Quicksort - O(n log n)
